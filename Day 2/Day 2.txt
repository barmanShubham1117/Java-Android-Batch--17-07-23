Operation - Operand - Operator => 2+3; simplify: 5*1-6-5+9/2

Types of Operators:
1. Arithmetic Operators (2 + 3 = 5)
    1.1 Unary Operators: operates on single operand
        1.1.1 Pre increment/decrement   (++a, --a)
        1.1.2 Post increment/decrement  (a++, a--)
    1.2 Binary Operators: operates with two operand
        1.2.1 Addition
        1.2.2 Substraction
        1.2.3 Multiplication
        1.2.4 Division
        1.2.5 Modulus
2. Relational Operators:    give answer in true/false
    2.1 >       is LHS is greater than RHS
    2.2 <       is LHS is smaller than RHS
    2.3 >=      is LHS is greater than or equal to RHS
    2.4 <=      is LHS is smaller than or equal to RHS
    2.5 ==      is LHS is equal to RHS
    2.6 !=      is LHS is not equal RHS
3. Logical Operators:    give answer in true/false
    3.1 &&      LOGICAL AND -> gives true only when both the conditions are true        ((person age should equal or greater than 18) && (person should have voter id card))
    3.2 ||      LOGICAL OR  -> gives true even if anyone of the statement is true       ((person age should equal or greater than 18) || (person should have voter id card))
    3.3 !       LOGICAL NOT -> changes true to false , and false to true
4. Bitwise Operators
5. Assignment Operators =, +=, -= => (a += 2) --> a = a + 2
6. Ternary Operators
    (__) ? <TRUE> : <FALSE>

11 -> 0 1 0 1 1
18 -> 1 1 1 0 1

11 & 18 -> 0 1 0 0 1

Conditional Statement:
1. if-else
2. switch case

Iterative Statement(loops):
1. while loop
    while (condition) {
        // Code to be executed
    }
2. do-while loop
    do {
        // Code to be executed
    } while (condition)
3. for loop
4. foreach loop
